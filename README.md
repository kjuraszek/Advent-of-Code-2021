# Advent of Code 2021
 
My solutions for 2021's edition of **Advent of Code** written in Python 3.9 .

## Usage

The best way to run each day's solution is by running *day_runner.py* script, e.g.:

`python3.9 day_runner.py --day=1`

It might be a good idea to create a virtual environment first by

`python3.9 -m venv venv`

and to activate it by

- `source venv/bin/activate` (on Linux)

- `& FULL_PATH_TO_PROJECT_ROOT/venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1` (on Windows)
